Christian Schaefer or better known as [@derSchepp](https://twitter.com/derschepp) on Twitter did a great summing up talk at the Microsoft - [_Technical Summit 2016_](https://www.microsoft.com/germany/technical-summit/default.aspx) a few weeks ago about the HTTP protocol history and the newest baby — HTTP/2 — in special.

You can watch the video below, but I'm sorry for the non-german readers… the talk was given in German by Christian as it is his native language and the summit took place in Darmstadt.

_Have fun!_
