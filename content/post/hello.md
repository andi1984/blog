## Place for thoughts and ideas

This is my first try since years to build up my own place to publish my ideas, thoughts on. Further on
it serves as a playground for me as a webdeveloper to test out ideas.

One idea is to progressively enhance this blog on the long run as a side project. So I "[...] start by establishing a basic
level of user experience that all browsers will be able to provide when rendering [...], but [...] also build
in more advanced functionality that will automatically be available to browsers that can use it." ([w3org](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement)).

## Progressively enhanced
So everything starts with the [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-html51-20160310/index.html#contents) — the Hypertext Markup Language, the _foundation_ of the web as [_Sir Tim Berners-Lee_](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)
started inventing and using it more then 25 years ago with his colleagues at CERN. And that's the beauty of the web: _backwards compatibility_. The 25 year old [pages](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) still work and they do it great in every browser, on every device on
every connection (ok not offline...) at this planet earth! But we throw [a bunch of bullshit](http://deathtobullshit.com) nowadays on our pages which often ruins
user experience and performance which was great before.

Beside of adding — _hopefully_ — new posts and content regularly, I will go ahead by adding [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2015/) — the Cascading Style Sheets — to this website with the goal to make this website _look_ and _feel_ great.

And then there is [JavaScript](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) from _Brendan Eich_ based on the ECMAScript specification. Used to provide enhanced interactivity and functionality on the web, "[...] but it also breaks easily if things go awry, and unlike HTML and CSS it does not come with a fail-safe mechanism" ([CSSence.com](http://cssence.com/blog/2016-11-the-javascript-wars)).

As I said I want to use this place as a playground. Trying things out extensively, maybe and probably fail in between and write about it.

## A [#webdev](https://twitter.com/andi1984/lists/web-development) blog

That's what I missed the last years. Writing about my own experience in my daily work when working on and with the web. I really want to _try_ it again to enable some sort of longterm place for writing those things down.

I'm happy to have a new "home" on the web!
