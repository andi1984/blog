Since more than two years I work now at [ÜberResearch GmbH](http://uberresearch.com/). [Which I already wrote about it (in 🇩🇪)]({{<relref path="/post/working-remote/index.md" lang="de">}}).

Pretty short after my start there, I was involved into brainstorming and prototyping for a new product. Now years later, at 15th of January 2018, we launched the first official version of it under [Dimensions.ai](https://dimensions.ai)! It is pleasing to see that initial ideas went into something ["game-changing"](https://figshare.com/s/68dcc69f3fe6189098bb) official which is used worldwide by researchers, funders, institutions and publishers.

But the best thing to see is that the product _means_ something to our users and they are doing their first steps inside the product, like [Jürgen Wastl](https://twitter.com/juergen_wastl/status/964163847488724992) or [Rony Armon](https://twitter.com/rony_armon/status/963840542542090240) did. I can see that the product I helped building up has a _value_ for them. This is sooo good to see!

In the end I'm just very grateful to be part of the awesome team behind it and it is just the start… there is more to come!
